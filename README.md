Hey there 👋🏼

I am just a dude passionate about learning and building performant software. 👨🏻‍💻

I started my career in tech by working in sales, but I wasn't your typical corporate bro. 

I always had a curiousity and drive to understand how technology worked and never liked to take an 'experts' word for it so this naturally led to learn more about technical topics and relaying features from customers with my engineering teams... That was the early thread that compelled me to learn more. 

Eventually I taught myself to code and was "hello world!" in 2020. I started with Python and SQL to be more helpful for data engineering use cases. It then led me to JS,TS, React, and Tailwind to round out my web development skills where I began to develop my own apps for various startups in cloud cost optimization, bitcoin, and now B2B analytics use cases. 

Now I predominately take interest in hacking, startups, security, data engineering, ML/AI, and continuously trying to become more competent at software engineering. ⚡️
