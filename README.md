Hey there 👋🏼

I am just a dude passionate about building things that are interesting to me. 👨🏻‍💻

I started my career in tech by working in sales, but I wasn't your typical sales person even though I was fairly decent at it. 📈

I always had a curiousity and drive to understand how technology worked and never liked to take an 'experts' word for it so this aspect of myself naturally led to discussing technical topics and relaying features from customers with my engineering teams... That was the early thread that compelled me to learn more and more until it led me to begin learn to code. 

Now I predominately take interest in indie hacking, startups, web dev, data engineering, ML/AI, and continuously trying to become more competent at software engineering. ⚡️
